# MuZero Chess Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

This document summarizes the complete implementation plan for a MuZero reinforcement learning agent that can play chess. The implementation follows the MuZero algorithm architecture and uses the python-chess library for accurate chess rules implementation.

## Implementation Components

### 1. Chess Environment
- **File**: `chess_environment.py`
- **Dependencies**: `python-chess` library
- **Key Features**:
  - Board state encoding as 8x8x19 tensors
  - Action encoding/decoding between neural network indices and UCI moves
  - Reward calculation based on game outcomes
  - Legal move generation and validation

### 2. Neural Network Components
- **File**: `muzero_network.py`
- **Dependencies**: PyTorch
- **Components**:
  - Representation Network (16 residual blocks)
  - Dynamics Network (processes hidden state and action)
  - Prediction Network (outputs policy and value)
  - Loss function implementation

### 3. MCTS Implementation
- **File**: `mcts.py`
- **Key Features**:
  - UCB1 action selection
  - Tree search with learned model
  - Dirichlet noise for exploration
  - Configurable search parameters

### 4. Training Loop
- **File**: `training_loop.py`
- **Components**:
  - Self-play game generation
  - Network training orchestration
  - Evaluation against previous versions
  - Checkpointing and logging

### 5. Replay Buffer
- **File**: `replay_buffer.py`
- **Features**:
  - Game history storage
  - Uniform and prioritized sampling
  - Memory-efficient storage

### 6. Evaluation Framework
- **File**: `evaluator.py`
- **Capabilities**:
  - Performance assessment against various opponents
  - Win/loss/draw statistics
  - Detailed game analysis

## Implementation Order

1. Chess Environment (`chess_environment.py`)
2. Neural Network Components (`muzero_network.py`)
3. MCTS Implementation (`mcts.py`)
4. Replay Buffer (`replay_buffer.py`)
5. Training Loop (`training_loop.py`)
6. Evaluation Framework (`evaluator.py`)
7. Main Interface (`muzero_chess.py`)

## Key Design Decisions

### State Representation
- 8x8x19 tensor encoding:
  - 12 channels for piece positions
  - 1 channel for player to move
  - 4 channels for castling rights
  - 1 channel for en passant target
  - 1 channel for halfmove clock

### Action Space
- 4672-dimensional action space:
  - 8Ã—8 for from square
  - 73 for move types

### Reward Structure
- Win: +

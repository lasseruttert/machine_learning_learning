# Chess Visualization System Design

## Overview

This document describes the design of a chess visualization system for the MuZero chess agent. The system will provide visual representation of chess games with animated piece movements.

## Requirements

1. Display a chess board with pieces
2. Animate piece movements during moves
3. Show game information (current player, move history, etc.)
4. Support different playback speeds
5. Integrate with the existing chess environment
6. Allow for interactive controls (pause, step, etc.)

## Technical Approach

### Library Selection

We'll use pygame for the visualization system because:
- Well-suited for game development and animations
- Handles real-time updates and user interaction
- Commonly used in reinforcement learning projects
- Easy integration with existing Python code

### System Architecture

```
ChessVisualizer
├── ChessBoardDisplay
├── PieceSprites
├── AnimationEngine
├── GameControls
└── GameStateInterface
```

## Core Components

### 1. ChessVisualizer Class

Main class that orchestrates the visualization system.

```python
class ChessVisualizer:
    def __init__(self, width=640, height=640):
        """Initialize the visualization system."""
        pass
        
    def initialize_board(self):
        """Set up the pygame window and board display."""
        pass
        
    def update_display(self, board_state):
        """Update the display with the current board state."""
        pass
        
    def animate_move(self, from_square, to_square, piece, duration=0.5):
        """Animate a piece moving from one square to another."""
        pass
        
    def run_game(self, game_moves):
        """Run a complete game with visualization."""
        pass
        
    def handle_events(self):
        """Handle user input events."""
        pass
```

### 2. ChessBoardDisplay

Handles the rendering of the chess board and pieces.

```python
class ChessBoardDisplay:
    def __init__(self, screen, board_size=640):
        """Initialize the board display."""
        pass
        
    def draw_board(self):
        """Draw the chess board squares."""
        pass
        
    def draw_pieces(self, board_state):
        """Draw the chess pieces on the board."""
        pass
        
    def highlight_square(self, square, color):
        """Highlight a specific square."""
        pass
```

### 3. PieceSprites

Manages the visual representation of chess pieces.

```python
class PieceSprites:
    def __init__(self, sprite_size=80):
        """Initialize piece sprites."""
        pass
        
    def load_sprites(self):
        """Load chess piece images."""
        pass
        
    def get_sprite(self, piece):
        """Get the sprite for a specific piece."""
        pass
```

### 4. AnimationEngine

Handles smooth animations for piece movements.

```python
class AnimationEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        """Initialize the animation engine."""
        pass
        
    def create_move_animation(self, from_pos, to_pos, duration):
        """Create an animation for a piece move."""
        pass
        
    def update_animation(self, dt):
        """Update all active animations."""
        pass
        
    def is_animating(self):
        """Check if any animations are active."""
        pass
```

## Integration with Chess Environment

The visualization system will integrate with the existing `ChessEnvironment` class:

```python
# Example usage
env = ChessEnvironment()
visualizer = ChessVisualizer()

# Reset environment and visualize
state = env.reset()
visualizer.update_display(env.board)

# Make moves and visualize
for move in game_moves:
    # Animate the move
    visualizer.animate_move(move.from_square, move.to_square, moving_piece)
    
    # Execute move in environment
    state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    
    # Update display
    visualizer.update_display(env.board)
```

## Features

### 1. Basic Visualization
- Chess board with alternating light and dark squares
- Chess pieces displayed in their correct positions
- Clear labeling of rows and columns

### 2. Move Animation
- Smooth movement of pieces from source to destination
- Visual feedback for captures
- Special animation for castling and en passant

### 3. Game Information
- Current player indicator
- Move history display
- Game status (check, checkmate, stalemate)

### 4. Controls
- Play/Pause functionality
- Step forward/backward through moves
- Speed control for animations
- Restart game option

## Implementation Plan

1. Set up pygame environment and basic window
2. Create chess board rendering
3. Implement piece sprite loading and display
4. Add basic move animation
5. Integrate with chess environment
6. Add game information display
7. Implement user controls
8. Test with sample games

## Dependencies

- pygame
- python-chess (already installed)
- numpy (already installed)

## File Structure

```
models/reinforcement_learning/muzero_chess/
├── chess_visualization.py     # Main visualization module
├── assets/                    # Piece sprite images
│   ├── pieces/               # Individual piece images
│   └── board/                # Board background
└── test_visualization.py     # Test script
```

## Testing

The visualization system will be tested with:
1. Static board display
2. Simple move animations
3. Complete game playback
4. User interaction controls
